## Basic String Methods
_________
In Python, strings are immutable. This means that they can't be modified. So if we wanted to fix a typo in a string, we can't simply modify the wrong character. We would have to create a new string with the typo corrected. We can also assign a new value to the variable holding our string.

If we aren't sure what the index of our typo is, we can use the string method index to locate it and return the index. Let's imagine we have the string "lions tigers and bears" in the variable animals. We can locate the index that contains the letter g using animals.index("g"), which will return the index; in this case 8. We can also use substrings to locate the index where the substring begins. animals.index("bears") would return 17, since that’s the start of the substring. If there’s more than one match for a substring, the index method will return the first match. If we try to locate a substring that doesn't exist in the string, we’ll receive a ValueError explaining that the substring was not found.

We can avoid a ValueError by first checking if the substring exists in the string. This can be done using the in keyword. We saw this keyword earlier when we covered for loops. In this case, it's a conditional that will be either True or False. If the substring is found in the string, it will be True. If the substring is not found in the string, it will be False. Using our previous variable animals, we can do "horses" in animals to check if the substring "horses" is found in our variable. In this case, it would evaluate to False, since horses aren’t included in our example string. If we did "tigers" in animals, we'd get True, since this substring is contained in our string.

## String Methods
```
>>> " hello world ".strip()
'helloworld' # removes whitespace

>>> " hello world ".lstrip()
"hello world ' # removes whitespace to the left

" hello world ".rstrip()
'hello world' # removes whitespace to the right
```

```
<INSDSeq>
<INSDSeq_locus>AAA59173</INSDSeq_locus>
text = re.sub('<INSD[^a-zA-Z]>', "", open("INSD.xml").read())

    AAA59173
text = re.sub('<[^<]+>', "", open("/path/to/file").read())
    (<INSD)(^\w+)(>)(^.$)(</.+>)
    (</?INSD)[^/w]+>
    ((<INSD|</INSD)|>|>)
    (<INSD[^[_\n]*_)|(</[^\n]*)|(<INSD)
    (<INSD[^[_\n]*_)|(</[^\n]*)|<([^\n&^>]*>\n)|(<INSD{1})
```


## String Formatting
________
You can use the format method on strings to concatenate and format strings in all kinds of powerful ways. To do this, create a string containing curly brackets, {}, as a placeholder, to be replaced. Then call the format method on the string using .format() and pass variables as parameters. The variables passed to the method will then be used to replace the curly bracket placeholders. This method automatically handles any conversion between data types for us. 

If the curly brackets are empty, they’ll be populated with the variables passed in the order in which they're passed. However, you can put certain expressions inside the curly brackets to do even more powerful string formatting operations. You can put the name of a variable into the curly brackets, then use the names in the parameters. This allows for more easily readable code, and for more flexibility with the order of variables.

You can also put a formatting expression inside the curly brackets, which lets you alter the way the string is formatted. For example, the formatting expression {:.2f} means that you’d format this as a float number, with two digits after the decimal dot. The colon acts as a separator from the field name, if you had specified one. You can also specify text alignment using the greater than operator: >. For example, the expression {:>3.2f} would align the text three spaces to the right, as well as specify a float number with two decimal places. String formatting can be very handy for outputting easy-to-read textual output.


## String Reference Cheat Sheet
__________
In Python, there are a lot of things you can do with strings. In this cheat sheet, you’ll find the most common string operations and string methods.

String operations:

* len(string) Returns the length of the string
* for character in string Iterates over each character in the string
* if substring in string Checks whether the substring is part of the string
* string[i] Accesses the character at index i of the string, starting at zero
* string[i:j] Accesses the substring starting at index i, ending at index j-1. If i is omitted, it's 0 by default. If j is omitted, it's len(string) by default.

String methods:

* string.lower() / string.upper() Returns a copy of the string with all lower / upper case characters
* string.lstrip() / string.rstrip() / string.strip() Returns a copy of the string without left / right / left or right whitespace
* string.count(substring) Returns the number of times substring is present in the string
* string.isnumeric() Returns True if there are only numeric characters in the string. If not, returns False.
* string.isalpha() Returns True if there are only alphabetic characters in the string. If not, returns False.
* string.split() / string.split(delimiter) Returns a list of substrings that were separated by whitespace / delimiter
* string.replace(old, new) Returns a new string where all occurrences of old have been replaced by new.
* delimiter.join(list of strings) Returns a new string with all the strings joined by the delimiter

## Iterating Over Dictionaries
________
You can iterate over dictionaries using a for loop, just like with strings, lists, and tuples. This will iterate over the sequence of keys in the dictionary. If you want to access the corresponding values associated with the keys, you could use the keys as indexes. Or you can use the items method on the dictionary, like dictionary.items(). This method returns a tuple for each element in the dictionary, where the first element in the tuple is the key and the second is the value.

If you only wanted to access the keys in a dictionary, you could use the keys() method on the dictionary: dictionary.keys(). If you only wanted the values, you could use the values() method: dictionary.values().
