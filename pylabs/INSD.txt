comment:On Aug 28, 1993 this sequence version replaced gi:186438.; Draft entry and sequence in computer-readable form for [1],[2] kindly provided by D.Owerbach, 15-OCT-1985. The nucleotide sequence of a long polymorphic region (positions 134-2096) located 365 bp upstream of the human insulin gene is composed of 139 repeating sequences whose consensus structure is related to &apos;acaggggtgtgggg&apos;. Expansion in the number of repeating sequences appears to have taken place through duplication and triplication of blocks of 8-10 repeats. However, ancestral polymorphic regions containing additions or deletions of 50 bp or more were not detected in two previous generations. The region 168-258 bp upstream from the transcription start site, containing essential control elements for efficient cell-specific expression, are the same. Thus linkage-disequilibrium between sequences in this control region and specific polymorphic regions is probably not the explanation for the disease association between the long polymorphic regions and atherosclerosis.; Method: conceptual translation.
